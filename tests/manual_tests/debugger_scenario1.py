### profileEditStyles.css

```diff
- max-width: 300px;
+ max-width: 500px;

- background-color: #f9f9f9;
+ background-color: #28a745;
```

### Explanation

1. **Form Width**: 
   - The form's `max-width` is increased from `300px` to `500px` to make it wider.

2. **Background Color**: 
   - The `background-color` is changed from `#f9f9f9` (light grey) to `#28a745` (green) to give the form a green background.

These changes will ensure that the form is wider with a green background, improving its styling as requested. No changes are needed in the `InternProfileEdit.vue` file for this task.
